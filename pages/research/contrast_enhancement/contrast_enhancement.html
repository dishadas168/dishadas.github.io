    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>In this paper, a new method of contrast enhancement is proposed 
        which takes into account the 2D Histogram equalization of an image. 
        In 1D Histogram equalization process, the neighbourhood of a pixel 
        is not considered which results in the highlighting of undesirable 
        artefacts in the image. To get rid of the shortcomings of 1DHE, 2DHE 
        has been implemented. In this paper, the results of some previously 
        proposed techniques of contrast enhancement have been compared qualitatively 
        and quantitatively with the newly devised 2DHE process. This process 
        takes into account the local contrast information which along with the 
        dynamic range information produces an improved equalized distribution. 
        This method can be applied to both grayscale as well as colour images 
        with small modification without any complexity.</p>
