    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>In this work, we tackle the problem of 3D object detection of 
        cars on the Kitti dataset. We approach this
        problem through two parallel deep learning frameworks,
        PointRCNN, and Frustum ConvNet, and we try to improve
        the performance from the default versions of these models
        through a variety of experiments. Overall, we were able
        to achieve higher performance in the medium and hard 3D
        AP (Average Precision) categories than the default models
        for PointRCNN and Frustum ConvNet. When comparing
        our two best models from the two respective deep learning
        frameworks, while our best Frustum ConvNet model performed 
        better in the Easy Category, our best PointRCNN
        model performed better in the Medium and Hard 3D AP
        Categories.</p>
