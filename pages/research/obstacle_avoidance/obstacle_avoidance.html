    <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Problem description</h3>
    <p>In order for a mobile manipulator to execute its task smoothly, it must take
        into account environment variables such as moving agents or obstacles. This
        can be done by moving the manipulator into a configuration that is atleast at a
        threshold distance from obstacles. To make sure this motion doesn’t affect the
        movement of the end-effector, redundant degrees of freedom have to be utilized
        to achieve collision-free configuration. The amount of flexibility depends on the
        degree of redundancy, i.e., on the number of redundant DOFs. Redundancy is
        defined as the difference between the required and available DOFs. The execution 
        of obstacle avoidance is of prime importance in tasks such as spray painting,
        arc welding, etc.</p>
    <p>The goal of this project is to utilize redundant degrees of freedom of a 6-link
        mobile manipulator to tackle the problem of obstacle avoidance. The endeffector
         of the manipulator with stationary base is subject to obstacles in its
        path to a goal pose. The primary objective of this project is to avoid coming in
        contact with obstacles under different scenarios.</p>
    <p>Thus, we are going to present a Software Project of type A, where we implement obstacle avoidance algorithms as are presented in [2] using GTSAM
        library. The code should determine the trajectory of the end-effector of the
        redundant manipulator in order to avoid obstacles.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Related Work</h3>
    <p>[1] presents a computationally efficient algorithm to deal with real-time demands
        of obstacle avoidance in practical applications. Their approach is to determine
        the required joint angle rates for the manipulator under the constraints of specified 
        end-effector trajectories and obstacle avoidance criterion. The obstacle
        avoidance technique used is to identify for each period in time the point on the
        manipulator that is nearest to the obstacle and assign to it a desired velocity
        component in the direction opposite to the obstacle surface.</p>
    <p>[2] presents a method of on-line obstacle avoidance of redundant manipulators
        based on redundancy resolution at the velocity level. The obstacle avoidance
        algorithms presented in this paper assign each point on the body of the manipulator, which is close to the obstacle, a velocity or force component in a
        direction that is away from the obstacle. This paper also presents a method
        of prioritizing between various tasks and utilizing this concept for multiple obstacle avoidance. A method for smooth transition between tasks as well as for
        varying the avoiding velocity has been presented in this paper.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Project Contribution</h3>
    <p>The two main goals performed by the manipulator with stationary base are :</p>
    <p><b>End-Effector Motion</b> - The redundant manipulator’s end-effector should reach
        the desired final destination from a given initial position.</p>
    <p><b>Obstacle Avoidance</b> - The mobile robot should avoid obstacles along the
        path traversed without colliding. We assume that the links of manipulator arm
        are not counted as obstacles, so they are free to overlap.</p>
    <p>The above goals were achieved for the following scenarios:
        <ul>
            <li>Scenario I : End-effector motion in the absence of obstacles</li>
            <li>Scenario II : Manipulator arm motion disturbed by the stationary obstacle</li>
            <li>Scenario III : End-effector motion disturbed by the stationary obstacle</li>
            <li>Scenario IV : Manipulator motion disturbed by moving obstacle</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>2 Approach</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Methodology</h3>
    <p>In a manipulator system, the relationship between the configuration variable <em>q</em>
        and the position of the end-effector <em>x</em> can be described by the following equation:</p>

        <div class="equation-container">
            <div class="equation">
              <p>x = f(q)</p>
            </div>
            <p>(1)</p>
          </div>

    <p>where <em>q</em> is an <em>m</em> dimensional vector for an <em>m</em> link arm. <em>x</em> gives the task space 
        vector of <em>n</em> dimensions. The corresponding relationship between the joint velocities
        <em>q&#775</em> and the task velocities <em>x&#775</em> is obtained by differentiating (1)</p>

        <div class="equation-container">
            <div class="equation">
              <p>x&#775 = Jq&#775;</p>
            </div>
            <p>(2)</p>
          </div>
    <p>Here, <em>J</em> is the <em>n &times m </em> Jacobian matrix. According to this equation, a motion
        in the joints results in a motion in the task space. This means that in order to
        calculate motion in joints that result from desired movement in the task space,
        the following equation is taken into account</p>

        <div class="equation-container">
            <div class="equation">
              <p>q&#775 = J<sup> -1</sup>x&#775;</p>
            </div>
            <p>(3)</p>
          </div>

    <p>where <em>J<sup> -1</sup></em> is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix <em>J</em>. An inverse is achieved
        for a square <em>J</em> matrix (Full-rank). But this is the case for a non-redundant
        manipulator. For a redundant manipulator (which is desired in our case), the
        dimensions of the joint space exceeds the dimensions of task space. Thus, the
        Jacobian matrix doesn’t turn out to be a square one. The inverse of <em>J</em> doesn’t 
        exist. For a generalized <em>J<sup>#</sup></em>, there can be infinite solutions for <em>q&#775</em>. Therefore we
        take the Moor-Penrose inverse <em>J<sup>+</sup></em>. A solution can be given as
    
        <div class="equation-container">
            <div class="equation">
              <p>q&#775 = J<sup>+</sup>x&#775 + Nφ&#775 = J<sup>+</sup>x&#775 + (I − J<sup>+</sup>J)φ&#775</p>
            </div>
            <p>(4)</p>
          </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>N</em> represents projection into the null space of <em>J</em> and <em>φ&#775</em> can be any <em>n</em> dimensional
        velocity vector. The 2nd term in rhs can be utilized to achieve obstacle avoidance
        or some other constraints. To perform this additional subtask, the velocity <em>φ&#775</em> is
        used. Then the secondary task is defined by some motion <em>x<sub>t</sub> = f<sub>t</sub>(q)</em> like in the
        case of obstacle avoidance, the velocity <em>φ&#775</em> can be defined as </p>

        <div class="equation-container">
            <div class="equation">
              <p>φ&#775 = J<sup>+</sup><sub>A</sub>x&#775<sub>A</sub></p>
            </div>
            <p>(5)</p>
          </div>

    <p>To avoid any possible obstacles the manipulator has to move away from them
        into a configuration where the distance between them becomes larger. Usually,
        the basic strategy for obstacle avoidance is to identify the points on the robotic
        arm that are near obstacles and then assign to them the motion component that
        moves those points away from the obstacle. The robot motion (configuration) is
        changed if at least one part of the robot is at a critical distance from an obstacle.
        We denote the obstacles that are closer to the critical distance as the active
        obstacles and the corresponding closest points on the body of the manipulator
        as the critical points. At any moment, if an active obstacle exists in the vicinity
        of the manipulator, then the equation for joint velocity is represented as</p>

        <div class="equation-container">
            <div class="equation">
              <p>φ&#775 = J<sup>+</sup><sub>e</sub>x&#775<sub>e</sub> + (I − J<sup>+</sup>J)J<sup>+</sup><sub>A</sub>x&#775<sub>A</sub></p>
            </div>
            <p>(6)</p>
          </div>

    <p>where <em>J<sup>+</sup><sub>A</sub></em> is the inverse Jacobian of the critical point and <em>x<sub>A</sub></em> is the motion
        of this critical point in a direction away from obstacle. However, there is a
        need to prioritize between end-effector motion and obstacle avoidance. In the
        above case, end-effector motion is given a higher priority because we are finding
        configurations in the null space of the first task for obstacle avoidance. In this
        case, if an obstacle comes in the way of the motion of end-effector, it collides
        with it. Hence, we give a higher priority to obstacle avoidance. this is done
        with the below equation.</p>

        <div class="equation-container">
            <div class="equation">
              <p>φ&#775 = J<sup>+</sup><sub>A</sub>x&#775<sub>A</sub> + (I − J<sup>+</sup><sub>A</sub>J<sub>A</sub>)J<sup>+</sup><sub>e</sub>x&#775<sub>e</sub></p>
            </div>
            <p>(7)</p>
          </div>
    <p>where <em>J<sup>+</sup><sub>e</sub></em>
         is the inverse Jacobian of end-effector. In this case, we are computing
        the viable position of end-effector in the null-space of obstacle avoiding configurations.
        In obstacle avoidance, the priority of the avoiding task may depend on the
        type of obstacle and on the distance to the obstacle. Therefore, it is beneficial
        if the control method enables a smooth change of task priorities. Therefore, a
        method for smooth transition was proposed by [2]:</p>

        <div class="equation-container">
            <div class="equation">
              <p>φ&#775 = J<sup>+</sup><sub>A</sub>x&#775<sub>A</sub> + (I − λ(x<sub>A</sub>)J<sup>+</sup><sub>A</sub>J<sub>A</sub>)J<sup>+</sup><sub>e</sub>x&#775<sub>e</sub></p>
            </div>
            <p>(8)</p>
          </div>

    <p>where <em>λ(x<sub>A</sub>)</em> is a scalar measure of how "active" is the primary task, scaling the
        vector <em>x<sub>A</sub></em> to the interval <em>[0, 1]</em>. When the primary task is active <em>λ</em> is <em>λ(x<sub>A</sub>) = 1</em>,
        and when the primary task is not active, it is <em>λ(x<sub>A</sub>) = 0</em>.</p>
    <p>We take <em>λ(x<sub>A</sub>) = α</em>. Formulation (8) allows an unconstrained joint movement while <em>α</em> is close to zero <em>(α ≈ 0)</em>. Thus, the robot can track the desired
        task-space path while it is away from the obstacle. On the other hand, when
        the robot is close to the obstacle <em>(α ≈ 1)</em>, the formulation in (8) takes the form
        (7) and only allows movement in the null space of the primary task, i.e., the
        obstacle-avoidance task.

    <h3>2.2 Project Implementation</h3>
    <p><b>Environment:</b> The project was implemented on Google Colaboratory in Python
        3.6.7 using the GTSAM Library.</p>
    <p><b>Manipulator motion execution:</b> The <em>animation</em> module of <em>matplotlib</em>
        library was used to execute manipulator motion. A 100 frame animation was
        used for the simulation of each scenario. The animations were then saved as
        .mp4 and .gif files.</p>
    <p><b>Functions:</b> A manipulator class for 6-link arm performs the following functions-
        <ul>
            <li><em>__init__</em> : Initialize six-link arm manipulator</li>
            <li><em>fk</em> : Forward kinematics.</li>
            <li><em>jacobian</em> : Calculate manipulator Jacobian.</li>
            <li><em>get_joint_positions</em> : Returns the x and y coordinates of each joint.</li>
            <li><em>first_task</em> : Calculates Jacobian and velocity of critical point.</li>
            <li><em>get_obstacle_distances</em> : Calculates distance of joints and mid points of links
                from obstacle.</li>
            <li><em>joint_mid_jacobian</em> : Calculates critical point Jacobian.</li>
            <li><em>avoid_obstacle</em> : Calculates velocity of critical point along opposite direction to the obstacle.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    <p><b>Algorithm:</b> The pseudo-code of the algorithm used has been presented in this
        report. The Project.ipynb notebook can be viewed for further clarification on
        the methods implemented.</p>
    <p><b>Novel implementation:</b> In [2], the poses along the trajectory are calculated
        once. However, in our implementation, we calculate in every iteration the set of
        poses along a trajectory that joins the current position of end-effector and the
        goal pose. This allows a shorter traversal path for the manipulator.

    <h2>3 Results</h2>
    <p>The algorithm is evaluated based on four scenarios. For the sake of simplicity,
        we use a single circular obstacle for each scenario. The obstacle is represented
        by the blue circle. The goal is represented as the red dot. The plot of distance
        of EE from goal is given to evaluate the smoothness of the end-effector path as
        we vary the alpha value.</p>
    <p>The algorithm was repeated multiple times using random positions of the goal
        pose, random initial joint angles and random centres of the obstacle. The results 
        of this experiment are presented in table 1. The two variables we consider
        are- whether collision occurs and whether the end-effector reaches the goal pose.</p>
    <p><b>Scenario 1:</b> In the first scenario, no obstacle is present. This scenario gives
        an estimate of the natural path of the end-effector in the absence of obstacles.
        Any deviations from this path will be evaluated in the subsequent scenarios.
        For the no obstacle scenario, the plot in Figure 1 is a linear one, given the value
        of alpha is 1.

        </figure>
    </p>
    <p><b>Scenario 2:</b> In this scenario, an obstacle is placed in a position so as to make
        the manipulator go around it to reach the goal pose. The manipulator is successful in 
        reaching the goal while avoiding the obstacle, as can be observed in
        the results. The distance vs frame plots in Figure 2 are given for values of alpha
        1, 0.5 and 0.05.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Scenario 3:</b> In this scenario, an obstacle is placed directly on the path of
        the end-effector. The end-effector successfully reaches the goal pose after deviating 
        from its path, just enough to avoid the obstacle. The distance vs frame
        plots in Figure 3 are given for values of alpha 1, 0.5 and 0.05.

        <b>Scenario 4:</b> This scenario consists of two runs of the program. In the first
        run, a moving obstacle is orchestrated to move diagonally such that it doesn’t
        cross the path of the end-effector. The movement of the manipulator is given
        for values of alpha 3, 1 and 0.5 (See Figure 4). In run 2, the moving obstacle
        is made to cross the path of the end-effector. This time the program takes the
        alpha values 2, 1 and 0.5 (See Figure 5).

    <h2>4 Discussion</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Evaluation of plots:</b> The alpha value helps in the smooth transition between
        the tasks. If alpha value is set high, then greater weight is given to the first
        task and vice versa. In the plots, it is observed that the greater the value of
        alpha, the greater is the weight placed on deviation due to obstacle avoidance,
        and the greater is the displacement of the end-effector with respect to the goal.
        On the other hand, too low a value of alpha makes the manipulator move over
        the obstacle without avoiding it. A middle ground is decided for each scenario,
        where the movements of end-effector are relatively smooth and the manipulator
        manages to avoid the obstacle. This is true for all the scenarios. In the failure
        scenario, for a very low level of alpha, the end-effector manages to reach the
        goal, but by moving over the obstacle.</p>
    <p><b>Evaluation of table 1:</b> From the table, it is observed that our algorithm
        is successful (reaches goal without bumping into the obstacle) 80% of the times
        it runs. However, there are certain other scenarios where reaching the goal is
        not that straight-forward.</p>
    <p>Collisions mainly occur due to a low value of alpha, whereby avoiding obstacles is 
        not given as high a priority as is required from the situation. Other
        reasons of collision occurrence could be the initialization of obstacle center in
        very close proximity to the arm links and joints, since we are randomly selecting
        obstacle coordinates.</p>
    <p>The reasons for the end-effector not reaching its goal could be due to the
        constant backtracking of EE due to displacement accountable to obstacle avoidance. 
        This leads to the slowing down of the progress of EE, as a result of which,
        it doesn’t complete its journey within the given number of frames.</p>
    <p>A failure scenario occurs when the manipulator is capable of reaching the
        goal by avoiding the obstacle, but it doesn’t. This happens in cases where the
        extension of manipulator arm is limited due to the presence of the obstacle.
        This is, clearly, a flaw in the algorithm. An obvious solution is to find reach
        around the obstacle in the other direction and extend the EE towards the goal
        pose. Incorporating this method is beyond the scope of this project and is left
        for future work.</p>
    <p><b>Future Work:</b> As observed in Table 1, collisions occur in some scenarios,
        and not in others. This is purely dictated by the value of alpha. The closer
        the obstacle, the greater should be the weight placed on avoiding it. Therefore,
        instead of fixing a value for alpha, it can be a function of the distance of the
        critical point from the obstacle.</p>
    <p>In this project, we have fixed the value of the velocity both during obstacle
        avoidance as well as trajectory tracking. Collisions can be prevented by tweaking 
        the avoiding velocity to increase in close proximity to the obstacle. This
        method can be implemented in a future work.</p>
    <p>In this project, we assigned a motion in the opposite direction to the obstacle
        at the critical point. Instead of doing this, we can make the critical point move
        in a tangential direction when it is in close proximity to the obstacle. Essentially, 
        when the critical point hits the threshold from the obstacle, it can either
        move to its right or left side (this is the tangential motion). If the goal lies to
        the left, the critical point moves left. Same for the other side. In future work,
        we’d want to investigate failure cases for this novel method.</p>
    <p>Another method to avoid failure cases is to make the manipulator bend in
        the other direction if it is unable to stretch itself enough to reach the goal pose
        due to obstacle.</p>
    <p>Environmental agents can be very complex and very unlike the simplistic
        model implemented in this project. Some features may be added to the model
        to make it realistic in a future work. This includes treating the manipulator
        links as obstacles, using multiple obstacles, obstacles with irregular boundaries,
        etc.
