    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>Reddit as a platform has made it easy for individuals to find communities 
        that support their esoteric interests. Reddit lets the users be
        active under the cloak of anonymity, thus freeing them to discuss
        topics that they wouldn’t have been able to in real life. Within
        Reddit, there exist communities that allow posting of personal problems 
        for collaborative solutions. Unfortunately, the same cloak of
        anonymity that frees up a user to discuss topics without fear of
        exposure, allows another user to spread about vicious ideologies
        that are abhorred by the public. To better understand the prevalence 
        of this problem, we analyzed the data from these spaces using
        Reddit’s API. Our analysis did show an increase in the negative
        discourse taking place in these safe spaces. Not only were users
        posting about their problems attacked, but also advice givers were
        attacked with negative words. Further failure to curb the usage of
        such language could drive down the engagement of users.</p>
