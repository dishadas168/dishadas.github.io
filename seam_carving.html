    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>This paper outlines a method used to successfully modify the Seam
        Carving algorithm so that it can be run to remove objects from
        videos in real time. The successful approach was a combination of
        multiprocessing speedups and what we called the “Spiral Model”.
        Resultant removal took about 35 milliseconds. The performant
        object recognition technique was not novel, but resulted in a total
        processing delay of less than .1 seconds and reasonably continuous
        video streaming while detecting and removing an object of interest.
        This paper will discuss the methods used and display the visual
        results of the approach.</p>

    <h2>1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Seam carving, as introduced in 2007 by Shai Avidan and Ariel
        Shamir, is a method of context-aware resizing [1]. It uses the amount
        of variation in greyscale intensity from one pixel to its neighbors
        as a value for how important that pixel is to an overall image.
        Removing a continuous seam of the lowest-valued pixels can allow
        a deletion of that seam without visually impacting the visually
        “important” parts of such an image.</p>

    <p>In the incredibly fast Greedy version of this algorithm, the lowest
        valued pixel is chosen from an edge of the image, and the seam
        then progresses across the image to each succeeding lowest-valued
        option. A better visual result is obtained if, instead of this method,
        a cumulative energy of the seam is calculated. Avidan and Shamir
        used dynamic programming to create a map of the cumulative
        minimum energy starting from each possible point on one edge and 
        traversing across the width or height of the image. This produces a
        more visually appealing image reduction, but takes much longer.</p>

    <p>One of the applications mentioned by the original research team
        was to remove a selected section of an image, and this is the portion
        we plan to replicate and enhance. This can be done with reasonable
        results in many cases, but takes a significant amount of time. An
        individual seam might be removed in real-time, but the original
        algorithm, even with Dynamic Programming optimizations and
        leveraging matrix- based math, requires an m(3n)+c calculation
        where n is the number of pixels in the image and m is the number
        of seam removals required to remove the image. Removing enough
        seams to remove an object of any substantial size, thus, takes far
        more than might be applied to real-time video.</p>

    <p>Applications of being able to do this in real time include removing 
        unwanted objects while live-streaming a video, or modifying
        incoming images on a heads-up display to not see indicated items.
        The overall motivation for this approach, although not specifically
        pursued here, was to be able to remove objects in real-time in an
        Augmented Reality scenario. There are some methods for doing so
        at present time, but they rely generally on foreknowledge of the
        environment surrounding the object to be removed.</p>

    <p>The value in this approach for AR environments is that it requires no 
        foreknowledge whatsoever, nor knowledge of what is
        behind the object being removed. Despite its current limitations in
        certain environments, the vision is that at some future time that this
        method could enable interactions that are not otherwise possible,
        such as making people invisible to others within the AR environment. 
        You could have, for example, objects that appear to float
        because you can’t see the support, or you could remove obvious
        tracking/reference tags from an AR game playing area.</p>

    <p>Seam carving optimizations so far have focused on post- processing. 
        An update to the algorithm in 2018 by Rubinstein, Shamir,
        and Avidan they claimed produced a 93% speedup when applied to
        post-processed video – but there was no attempt to apply any of
        the ideas of the speedup in real-time [6]. Another pre-print paper
        by Chuning Zhu uses “parental labeling” to speed up execution,
        but sees a video as a 3 dimensional object and requires additional
        computation in order to extract a seam for an individual frame, and
        the speedup is only discussed as a processing aspect of the overall
        video [2].</p>
        
    <p>This project combined multiple methods to speed up the Seam
        Carving algorithm so that it can be run to remove objects from
        videos in real time. While the video and forward energy methods
        did not significantly change the computation time, novel optimization 
        using a combination of MatLab’s matrix math and parallel
        processing capabilities (inspired by the work by Duarte and Sendag
        [3] and by the work by Huang et al. [4]) with some basic supporting
        algorithmic changes was successful to significantly reduce compute
        time, though still not sufficient for real-time processing. Within the
        further algorithmic optimizations attempted, some were sourced
        from extant papers and some were novel ideas. While modification
        of the methods attempted by other works was insufficient, a novel
        algorithm was successfully developed which will be the focus of
        this paper. Essentially, this algorithm divides the total image into
        sub-sections to calculate multiple seams for simultaneous removal.</p>

    <h2>2 APPROACH</h2>
    <p>Our “baseline” run of the standard seam carving algorithm produced
        an 898 ms time for removing an object that was 10% of the total
        image size on a 300x300 pixel image. Although not truly real-time,
        100 ms (or .1 seconds) is a maximum latency often used in commercial 
        video software as “real time” or “low latency” . There were
        multiple limiting factors to consider for developing an appropriate
        algorithm. Not only did we need to optimize the Seam Carving
        algorithm itself to run in less than .1 seconds per frame, but we
        also needed to ensure that it could run with an object detection or
        tracking algorithm. This constrained the time available to whatever
        portion of the .1 seconds would not be required by the detection
        algorithm. From the other direction, the hardware on which the
        algorithm would be deployed was important to the overall runtime.
        With the goal of real-time deletion in mind, it was important to
        frame the restriction of time on the Seam Carving portion with
        these algorithmic and hardware constraints.</p>

    <p>In order to be able to remove a specific object in real time, the object
        needed to first be found. Initially, we attempted to implement SIFT
        object detection to find, and subsequently remove, an object. SIFT
        required approximately 5 seconds per frame on average, and could
        thus not operate at real-time. We also tested MATLAB face detection
        from the CascadeObjectDetector available in MATLAB in order to
        find and track a face, which ran at an average of approximately 1.4
        seconds per frame.</p>
    <p>There are multiple techniques currently being used for real-time
        location and tracking of objects. Many of the successful methods,
        such as YOLO [5] require machine learning in order to implement,
        and their success and speed can vary widely based on the model
        that is trained. Improving object recognition and tracking times
        was not the intent of this work, and so a simplistic approach was
        pursued instead.</p>
    <p>Two other methods were attempted for object detection. From
        SIFT we moved to a much simpler method, using a Hough transform
        circle detector to recognize the tennis ball in images and videos.
        Roughly speaking, this algorithm leverages an edge detector to find
        edges in an image, creates a black/white map of where edges exist
        in that image, and then uses that map to check whether a circle of
        a specific radius would line up with the “edge” lines existing at said
        radius away from each point in an image. Despite the number of
        checks necessary in this method, and the need to run the whole
        algorithm for each circle radius tested, it runs quite quickly. The
        MatLab implementation of this, imfindcircles, was marginally faster
        than our implementation, and so we did use that method. We tuned
        the system, however, for sensitivity as well as to accept a range of
        circle sizes, and used our image tests to find values and ranges that 
        would work well in the majority of our test cases without slowing
        the processing time outside of our target time.</p>
    <p>The values that worked against all four of our sample images, and
        worked adequately against video, were circle size ranges between
        8 and 22 pixels, with sensitivity at .9 rather than MatLab’s default
        .8. Processing a larger range than that significantly slowed down
        our system, and processing a smaller range caused the tennis ball
        to often re-appear when the camera was moved. This basic HoughCircle 
        detector ran at the times given in Table 1. Simple HSV-based
        blob detection functioned in avg <400 ms time, but had a high error
        rate in our test cases, even using a brightly colored tennis ball on a
        bland environment.</p>

    <h2>2.2 Hardware Speedups</h2>
    <p>In the 2009 paper by Huang et al., they leveraged a CPU-GPU
        teamed system in order to improve the speed of processing of the
        Seam Carving algorithm [4]. In order to support parallelization
        of the energy image calculation, however, they also took other
        shortcuts. The results were much closer to the Greedy approach to
        Seam Carving, with similarly inadequate visual results. To some
        extent, modern computing enables a degree of multi-processing. Of
        particular interest was a move to GPU- based processing of matrices,
        which is a hardware speedup for all matrix operations. Although
        this is not useful in speeding up the dynamic programming methods
        for calculating the forward energy matrix, it is exceptionally useful
        for actually removing and re-adding seams to the image.</p>
    <p>At a basic level, we pushed a portion of the processing to the
        GPU in order to optimize the run time. We first converted the algorithm 
        to leverage matrixes wherever possible, surprisingly reducing
        the overall runtime by nearly 1/3. We then moved to GPU based
        processing of still images. This can be done in Matlab simply by
        creating GPUArrays. This had no noticeable effect on the results of
        images in the 500x500 range, which is the size that we planned to
        use for our real-time testing. We did see some gains in much larger
        images, but those were out of scope for this project.</p>

<section>
    <h2>2.3 Algorithmic Speedups</h2>
    <p>The basic optimization undertaken was to convert the arrays to
        GPU arrays, and emphasize matrix-based math rather than single
        operations. MatLab, it was discovered, natively multi-threads for
        matrix operations, creating a significant speed-up when, for example, a value was added or subtracted from every element in a matrix.
        One of the most significant speedups in this was in calculating the
        energy image, where instead of subtracting the next pixel from
        each pixel, an array of values to be subtracted were created by
        multiplying the array by -1, shifting it one pixel, and adding the
        two matrices.</p>
    <p>The first major algorithmic change to be attempted, though it
        was suspected that this would create visual issues, was to modify
        the image into subsections. Somewhat obviously, this can be done
        easily by bisecting the image through the object to be removed,
        but the method becomes complex when attempting to generate
        more than two sub-sections. The algorithms we tested for handling
        the multi-split and the border regions between sections entirely
        negated the speedup gained by simultaneous multi-processing of
        more than two sub-images, and the two sub-image variant simply
        wasn’t fast enough.</p>
    <p>The Spiral Model was an unexpected success. In the initial testing,
        the model showed significant visual artifacts. The spiral model
        makes the assumption that, since we are deleting an object and the
        minimum energy seam must, necessarily, traverse the portion of
        the image where that object is, the cumulative energy map that
        most-needs recalculating after a removal is the map in the columns
        and rows directly correlated to the object to be removed. This
        novel algorithm for very fast seam carving has the following basic
        concept: 1. Calculate a binary “map” of the object to be removed 2.
        Use the map to weight the cost of passing through the object, such
        that all removals will pass through the object 3. While the width or
        height of the section to be removed are greater than zero: a. Update
        the left side sub-section: i. Find the energy image from the left side
        to the center of the area to be removed to find the least- impactful
        seam ii. Expand a sub-section of the image along the minimum
        energy path, creating a blend in the new seam iii. The result will
        overlap the center; update the image iv. Reduce the width by one
        (check nonzero) b. Update the top sub-section: (i– iii are identical)
        iv. Reduce the height by one (check nonzero) c. Update the right
        sub-section d. Update the bottom sub-section</p>
    <p>This runs very fast, able to perform deletions where the max
        dimension is 60 pixels in less than 35 miliseconds, allowing 15
        miliseconds leeway to our optimal success criteria and taking far
        less than half of the needed time for our minimum success criteria. 
        Although this was done on images that were approximately
        200x200 to 300x300, and the image size does still significantly affect 
        performance, this can be made faster in large images (greater
        than 1000 x 1000) by using the GPUArray type in MATLAB. Using
        GPUArray to leverage GPU processing power, beyond MATLAB’s
        native optimizations, did not produce a noticeable difference in the
        image sizes we primarily studied.</p>
    <p>It was expected that this would create very obvious visual artifacts 
        in diamond shapes. In some cases, it did so, but in surprisingly
        many cases, while you could tell that there was something wrong
        with the resultant image, what was wrong was not obvious at a
        casual glance. This was a great surprise, and caused us to focus
        on this method, rather than on improving other methods. A few
        sample images are shown in Table 2, including the “perfect” case
        solid black image. As is, perhaps, obvious, only the “Leaves” image
        shown was captured in nature by the target Raspberry Pi system.
        The algorithm performed particularly poorly in indoor office environments, 
        but this is also true for the seam carving method in
        general.</p>

    <p>Initial experimentation was performed on an ordinary consumer
        laptop computer with an Intel Core i7-7700 2.81 GHz CPU. The
        system had 16 GB of RAM and an NVIDIA Quadro M1200 GPU.
        It was critical that the system had a GPU in order for changes to
        Matrix-based math to be the most impactful on the overall runtime
        of the algorithm. At the time of writing, this is a mid-range graphics
        card for mobile workstations.</p>

    <p>An initial goal of this project was to run the resultant algorithm
        on a video camera attached to a Raspberry Pi. MatLab has excellent
        support for creating video and image processing code tailored to the
        Raspberry Pi, and we used a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with a Camera V2, 
        which is capable of wireless communication and runs for Matlab on
        a modified version of Raspbian. This proved infeasible; a nontrivial
        part of the speedup made was due to the change to matrix-based
        operations optimized for GPU processing. As the Raspberry Pi does
        not have a GPU, these were not available.</p>
    <p>What we were reasonably able to do was implement a networked
        solution, handing off processing from the RPi to our i7 and 1080.
        Although documentation suggested the latency on a local network
        should be <2 ms, in practice we found total times averaged 20ms
        higher. Discovering the issue with network latency was deemed to
        be out-of-scope for this project, as the additional time was, nonetheless, 
        lower than our goal time.</p>

    <h2>4 CONCLUSIONS</h2>
    <p>Overall, the results were unexpected. When directly manipulating
        Forward Energy calculations for experimentation, it was found that
        it was much slower to perform seam carving given those calculations. 
        A fair amount of speedup was achieved by removing multiple
        seams in forward-energy calculated images before recalculating
        the image function, resulting in a slightly lower total calculation
        time.</p>
    <p>In the basic algorithmic work, there were also many surprises.
        MatLab natively takes advantage of multiprocessing capabilities
        when doing matrix operations, and so processing on the GPU
        achieved very little change in total calculation time. Although it
        was expected that the spiral method would be faster but cause visual 
        artifacts, it was unexpected that the split method would be
        very successful without any obvious artifacts. For ordinary seam
        carving, a combination of the GPU speedup, the split method, and
        the multiple simultaneous seam removal within the forward energy
        function may be adequate. For object removal in the range of ten
        percent of image size, the split method is inadequate.</p>
    <p>The video method did not significantly change the computation
        time. Some optimization was obtained with the forward energy
        method, however the initial energy matrix calculation takes significantly 
        longer than the comparable matrix in the original method,
        enough currently to offset the gains achieved, but it bears further
        attempts at optimization. Speedups were obtained with some algorithmic 
        changes, but they are not yet adequate for real-time
        running because either they weren’t fast enough or they caused
        visible artifacts in the images.</p>
